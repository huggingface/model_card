# model_card templates

We recommend sharing information about each model in a `model_card`.

The canonical documentation about model cards is at https://huggingface.co/docs

One of the easiest way to get started is by using our template card. Simply copy `template.README.md` to `model_cards/USERNAME/MODELNAME/README.md` and fill it out while studying [demo.README.md](./demo.README.md) for an example of a model `model_card` and referring to rest of this short document if you are not sure about some specific fields.

## YAML metadata section

Here is a sample of a typical yaml metadata section:
```
---
language:
- ru
- en
thumbnail: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetRunner/BERT-of-Theseus/master/bert-of-theseus.png
tags:
- translation
- fsmt
license: apache-2.0
datasets:
- wmt19
metrics:
- bleu
- sacrebleu
---
```

**Important**:
* This section has to be first in the document, before any markdown sections.
* The data in this section doesn't need to be repeated again in the subsequent markdown sections - since it'll be automatically expanded into a user-friendly format on the website.

## Markdown


# Model name

## Model description

You can embed local or remote images using `![](...)`

## Intended uses & limitations

#### How to use

```python
# You can include sample code which will be formatted
```

#### Limitations and bias

Provide examples of latent issues and potential remediations.

## Training data

Describe the data you used to train the model.
If you initialized it with pre-trained weights, add a link to the pre-trained model card or repository with description of the pre-training data.

## Training procedure

Preprocessing, hardware used, hyperparameters...

## Eval results
